InfiniX - Instant Insurance, Infinite Possibilities

## Introduction

Welcome to InfiniX, where we aim to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) by offering instant insurance solutions with infinite possibilities. InfiniX addresses the inherent risks and challenges faced by investors in the volatile DeFi market by providing customizable loss limits, instant fund settlements, and integration with parametric insurance.

## Problem Statement

The DeFi space presents lucrative opportunities for investors but also comes with significant risks due to market volatility and lack of security measures. InfiniX identifies the following key problems:

### No Security on Highly Volatile Investment in DeFi
Current DeFi protocols lack robust security measures to limit potential losses in highly volatile markets, exposing investors to significant risks.

### 14 Days LSU Settlement Period
Long settlement periods in other DeFi platforms lead to liquidity issues and reduce investor trust due to delayed access to funds.

### Lack of Parametric Insurance Solutions
Existing DeFi protocols do not offer parametric insurance solutions to automatically protect against predefined risks, leaving investors vulnerable to unforeseen events.

## Solution

InfiniX offers a comprehensive solution to address the challenges faced by DeFi investors:

### Customizable Loss Limits on Staking
Investors can set customizable loss limits on their staked assets, allowing them to define their risk tolerance and mitigate potential losses.

### Instant Fund Settlement
InfiniX ensures instant settlement of funds, providing investors with immediate access to their assets without the delays associated with traditional settlement periods.

### Parametric Insurance Integration
Our platform integrates parametric insurance solutions, automatically triggering payouts based on predefined conditions such as market fluctuations or protocol failures, providing investors with added security and peace of mind.

## Future Projection

### June - July
- Improve Smart Contract Functionality
- Enhance Security Measures

### September
- Integrate Oracle for Real-Time Feed
- Launch DApp (Decentralized Application)

### November
- Scale Platform and Business Operations










# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
