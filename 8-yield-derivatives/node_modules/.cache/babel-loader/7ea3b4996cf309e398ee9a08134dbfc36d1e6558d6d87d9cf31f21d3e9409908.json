If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,\n * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.\n * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment\n * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be\n * emitted within specified period since previous value.\n *\n * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws\n * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between\n * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete\n * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting\n * stream behaves just as source Observable.\n *\n * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)\n * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan\n * ```ts\n * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { timeout } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const seconds = interval(1000);\n *\n * seconds.pipe(timeout(1100))      // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,\n *                                  // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.\n * .subscribe(\n *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.\n *     err => console.log(err),     // Will never be called.\n * );\n *\n * seconds.pipe(timeout(900))\n * .subscribe(\n *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.\n *     err => console.log(err),     // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,\n *                                  // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * Use Date to check if Observable completed\n * ```ts\n * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { timeout } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const seconds = interval(1000);\n *\n * seconds.pipe(\n *   timeout(new Date(\"December 17, 2020 03:24:00\")),\n * )\n * .subscribe(\n *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would\n *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.\n *     err => console.log(err)      // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,\n *                                  // since Observable did not complete by then.\n * );\n * ```\n * @see {@link timeoutWith}\n *\n * @param {number|Date} due Number specifying period within which Observable must emit values\n *                          or Date specifying before when Observable should complete\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler] Scheduler controlling when timeout checks occur.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that mirrors behaviour of source, unless timeout checks fail.\n * @method timeout\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function timeout<T>(due: number | Date,\n                           scheduler: SchedulerLike = async): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T> {\n  return timeoutWith(due, throwError(new TimeoutError()), scheduler);\n}\n"],"mappings":"AAAA;AAKA,SAASA,KAAA,QAAY,oBAAQ;AAE7B,SAASC,YAAW,QAAQ,sBAAgB;AAC5C,SAASC,WAAU,QAAQ;AAgF3B,SAAMC,UAAU,QAA6B,0BACc;OAAhC,SAAAC,QAAAC,GAAA,EAAAC,SAAA;EACzB,IAAAA,SAAO,KAAW,KAAI,CAAE;IACzBA,SAAA,GAAAN,KAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
